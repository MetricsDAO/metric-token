# $METRIC

This is the ERC20 token used to drive the $METRIC network first spawned by [MetricsDAO](https://metricsdao.xyz).

Living as the *Maintenance Token*, $METRIC is designed to be omni-chain and traverse to the chain any individual protocol and audience are operating on. To make this a reality, integration with [LayerZero](https://layerzero.network/) to power an inline token bridge.

> With the utilization of LayerZero, the governing body of $METRIC may control the existing parameters of the token at any given time. While Governors have the ability to configure the state of LayerZero, there is no ability for any user to impact the ownership record of another without proper allowance.

Additionally included in $METRIC is [ERC20Votes](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc20#ERC20Votes) so that governance models can be applied to the $METRIC network with ease and from day 1.
