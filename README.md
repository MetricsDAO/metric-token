# In Development: Omni-Chain $METRIC

> Warning: This is not completed and has many loose ends as well as no tests. An active WIP for the amazing, MetricsDAO.

This is an open letter to my friends at Tally ðŸ‘‹ Please support ERC20VotesTimestamp. I will be in our debt.

**Todo:**
- [x] Community feedback/response implementation.
- [x] Multicall implementation.
- [ ] Contract tests.
- [ ] Proper README.

**Questions to answer:**
- [ ] Does OFT by default enable any chain communication that is supported?    
- [ ] If yes, would it be preferred for that not to be the case?
- [ ] Can we run our own LayerZero Oracle.
- [ ] If we start running now, will it really keep working even if / when a fee is added?
